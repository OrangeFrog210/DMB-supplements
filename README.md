Supplementary files and computer lab manual for "Dynamic Models in Biology" (PUP 2006) by Ellner &amp; Guckenheimer

Your best moves would be to clone the repository, or grab the whole thing as a zip file. It includes the current R-based version
of the computer lab manual and associated script files, and matlab versions that have not been used in quite some time.
