Supplementary files and computer lab manual for "Dynamic Models in Biology" (PUP 2006) by Ellner and Guckenheimer. 

Your best moves would be to clone the repository, or grab the whole thing as a zip file. It includes the current R-based version of the computer lab manual and associated script files, and matlab versions that have not been used in quite some time.  

The files DynamicModelsFiguresX.pdf are the authors' original versions of all figures in the book. Many of them were re-drawn by PUP, which holds copyright on the the re-drawn figures, so we are unable to distribute the final version of those figures. 

The two *.txt files are data files needed for exercises in the lab manual and/or textbook.
