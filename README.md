Supplementary files and computer lab manual for "Dynamic Models in Biology" (Princeton University Press 2006) by Ellner and Guckenheimer. 

Your best moves would be to clone the repository, or grab the whole thing as a zip file. It includes the current R-based version of the computer lab manual and associated script files, and matlab versions that have not been used in quite some time.  

The files DynamicModelsFigures{1,2}.pdf are the authors' original versions of all figures in the book. Many of the figures were redrawn by PUP, which holds copyright on the redrawn figures, so we are unable to distribute the final version of all figures. 

The two *.txt files are data files needed for exercises in the lab manual and/or textbook. 

ThistleExercise.tex and RM Bifurcation Exercise.tex and are two computer projects that we often do as in-class small group exercises. We use ThistleExercise.tex in lieu of lecturing about applications of eigenvalue sensitivity analysis (Chapter 2), and RM Bifurcation Exercise.tex as an in-class "warm-up" for using RPplane to study bifurcations in the Fitzhugh-Nagumo model during a completer lab session (Chapter 5).
